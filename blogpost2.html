            As investors continue to sell their investments due to the volatile markets and a fear of recession,
            cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are seeing major losses, with the currency falling as much as 14 percent.
            Bitcoin’s selloff, sparked by a reversal of the buying mania that drove it higher, has now become the
            fourth-deepest in the cryptocurrency’s 13-year history.

            On Monday, bitcoin fell 15% to $23,250.72 as of 5 p.m. ET, according to Dow Jones Market Data, its lowest
            level since December 2020. That reflected a 66% drop from its high of $67,802.30 in November 2021. The
            popular digital currency dropped further late in the day to about $21,000, according to CoinDesk.

            Bitcoin’s slide since November has contributed to a roughly $2 trillion wipeout in the broader market.
            Crypto’s total market capitalization, which peaked in November at nearly $3 trillion, stood at around $975
            billion Monday evening, according to data provider CoinMarketCap.
            There are some clear reasons why bitcoin is selling off now. For one thing, its moves have been generally
            more aligned with other risk assets, like tech stocks, as professional traders have joined the crypto market
            in bigger numbers. Speculative assets like crypto have been falling as high inflation persists and central
            banks try to combat that with higher interest rates. That dynamic makes riskier investments less attractive
            than safer assets. On Friday, the U.S. inflation index hit 8.6%, dragging down the stock market.

            As turbulence rippled through the crypto market over the weekend, a widely used cryptocurrency lender froze
            customer withdrawals. Celsius Network LLC said it was pausing all withdrawals, swaps between
            cryptocurrencies and transfers between accounts “due to extreme market conditions.” As of May, the lender
            managed $11 billion in user assets, according to its website.
