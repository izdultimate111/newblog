            The story of the world's best known cryptocurrency is astonishingly fast-moving and its fans will soon line
            up to tell you you've got it all wrong.
            But write about it we must, because the past 24 hours have been catastrophic for the grande dame of
            cryptocurrency - even by Bitcoin standards.

            I'm going to concentrate on Bitcoin here - but if you're a crypto follower, you'll know the whole market is
            troubled, to put it mildly.
            <br>
            <br>
            As I write this, Bitcoin is trading at $21, 974 (Â£18,000). It's fallen 25% in the past five days alone, to
            its What's happening to Bitcoin?lowest value in 18 months. Its peak of almost $70,000, in November, feels a
            lifetime ago.

            Experts say this is because of the wider global climate. It's not just in the crypto world things are not
            looking good.

            Recession looms, inflation is soaring, interest rates are rising and living costs are biting. Stock markets
            are wobbling too, with the US S&P 500 now in a bear market (down 20% from its recent high).
            As a result, even the big investors are less free with their money. And many ordinary investors - not rich
            hedge-fund owners or corporations but people like you and me - have less to invest in anything, full stop.
            <br>
            <br>
            For many, an investment in something as volatile and unpredictable as cryptocurrency feels like a risk too
            great in these times.

            It's unregulated and unprotected by the financial authorities, so if you're using your savings to invest in
            it and it loses value, or you lose access to your crypto wallet, your money has gone.
