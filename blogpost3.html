            BlockFi and Crypto.com are just two companies feeling the hurt, but there’s no real end to what the industry
            is already calling it summertime "crypto winter". The most recent crypto crash is causing quite a lot of
            reviled FUD (a term used in the community for fear, uncertainty, and doubt) not only among investors but
            inside the companies as well, though in the latter’s case its for their job prospects. The crypto lending
            company BlockFi announced Monday it was slashing 20%, or around 170 people from its total staff of around
            850.
            <br>
            <br>
            In a blog post, founders Zac Prince and Floria Marquez said the cuts are impacting every team within the
            company. Separately, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek wrote on twitter last Friday they were cutting 260
            workers, about 5% of their workforce. They’re not the only ones telling staff to hit the road. The crypto
            company Gemini recently cut 10% of its staff, equivalent to somewhere around 100 employees. In this “crypto
            winter” linked to the fall of the Terra/Luna ecosystem, it seems like nobody’s really able to keep warm.
            <br>
            <br>
            “We are doing everything in our power to treat all of our impacted colleagues with the empathy and
            compassion that they deserve,” the BlockFi founders wrote in their post. In addition to cuts, the company is
            reducing spending on marketing and executive pay, though of course they didn’t say by how much. The founders
            further said that users and clients shouldn’t see anything change regarding their services.
