            Some experts believe that crypto markets will bounce back from the current crash in the next few months,
            others think that investor wariness is going to persist in the near-short term. Crypto markets have
            witnessed massive corrections in the last two months. As of today, the global cryptocurrency market cap has
            shrunk to $949 billion, from the $3 trillion high it touched in November 2021. Weak global cues amid
            heightened inflation and interest rate hikes have led to a massive sell-off in crypto markets. Investors and
            traders are now wondering whether the crypto markets will bounce back again this year. Crypto industry
            experts have different views on this question.

            While some experts believe that crypto markets will bounce back from the current crash in the next few
            months, others think that investor wariness is going to persist in the near-short term. “I strongly think
            crypto will rise again. By August 2022, the bloodbath and crypto winter should be over. By December end or
            January 2023, Bitcoin may rise to an all-time high of $70,000,” Dileep Seinberg, founder and CEO, MuffinPay,
            a bill payment and utility token, told FE Online.

            The correlation between crypto and financial markets is growing. Cryptos have responded in tandem with the
            global financial markets that have also been hit due to weak global cues.

            As inflation is going to persist for around two years, experts say that an imminent economic recession may
            continue to make crypto markets fragile.

            “Given the high co-relation of equity and crypto markets, macroeconomic headwinds such as decade-high
            inflation and rising commodity prices adversely impact crypto markets. US Federal Reserve’s aggressive
            stance on quantitative tightening to tame inflation will further aggravate the downtrend in crypto prices.
            Since the US money supply has been growing at a rate of 18 percent, three times the growth rate, inflation
            will be around for a couple more years and is not transitory in nature,” said Sharat Chandra, VP, Research
            and Strategy at blockchain-based identity management platform EarthID.
